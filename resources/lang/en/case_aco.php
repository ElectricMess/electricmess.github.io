    'subtitle1' => 'Challenge',
    'text1' => 'Assassin’s Creed is one of the world’s most successful video game franchises. Nevertheless, it hit a slump after a decade, and sales began declining year over year. This was attributed to the failure of two successive Assassin’s Creed releases to live up to the hype of their trailers. Our objective was to restore trust in the franchise.',

    'subtitle2' => 'Strategy',
    'text2' => 'Throughout its history, the Assassin’s Creed franchise has won the hearts of its fair share of fans, yet it has also turned many of them off.

    'subtitle3' => 'Creative Solution',
    'text3' => 'We launched ExploreAncientEgypt.com, a website where gamers could book immersive guided tours within the actual game build. There, they could explore never-before-seen regions of the game map and bring back digital memories in the form of Instagram and Facebook-like stories that they could then customize and share everywhere on their social platforms—just as any excited tourist would.',

    'subtitle4' => 'Results',
    'text4' => 'On average, visitors spent 14 minutes on the tours. Fans shared thousands of “stories”, generating most of the reach through social earned media. Most importantly, as it was not Ubisoft but actual gamers who shared this exclusive game content, we completed our objective of restoring trust in the franchise. This campaign contributed to achieving the best-ever launch of an Assassin’s Creed game. Some 1.5 million units were sold in the first week, which is twice as much as the previous title of the saga.',
