Awareness campaigns barely move the needle on their rates of imbibing, nor do they succeed in influencing consumers to drink more responsibly. ',

    'text2' => 'To raise consumer awareness of this issue and help a new generation of regular drinkers drink more responsibly, the Quebec association Let’s Drink Better, a collective of restaurant and bar owners, wanted to give a voice to the part of you that remembers every drink you’ve ever had and every hangover you’ve suffered through: your liver. ',

    'text3' => 'We created My Liver, a conversational chatbot designed for social drinkers. Available 24/7 on Facebook Messenger, My Liver analyzes the effects of alcohol, tracks consumption, provides helpful, personalized advice on how to avoid nasty hangovers, and tests users’ alcohol tolerance through mini-games. In My Liver, drinkers can find a real friend to talk to on nights out and, more importantly, a relevant tool to help manage their harmful consumption behaviour.',
