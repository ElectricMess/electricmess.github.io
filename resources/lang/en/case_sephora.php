    'subtitle1' => 'Challenge',
    'text1' => 'Sephora Canada struggled in recent years to find the proper balance between prestige and approachability, causing confusion and brand fragmentation in the marketplace. Our task was to find this balance while also adapting Sephora’s global brand DNA to the Canadian market.',

    'subtitle2' => 'Process',
    'text2' => 'We conducted in-depth ethnographic research using a unique BBR approach called Fieldtrip, in which real consumers represent Sephora’s different audience segments in the Greater Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver areas. Interviews were also conducted with Sephora’s own make-up artists and associates, and with members of head office. The process culminated in a 2-day work session with stakeholders.',

    'subtitle3' => 'Strategy',
    'text3' => 'The research identified a core beauty need state common to both clients and non-clients. This need state was then translated into an archetype unique to Sephora Canada that would become the guiding light for defining the brand’s tone of voice.',

    'subtitle4' => 'Results',
    'text4' => 'We developed the first-ever brand book for Sephora in Canada, which has since become the essential how-to guide for operationalizing tone of voice in all Sephora Canada owned channels, including website, social, in-store communications and in-store sales associate scripts and greetings.',
