This space was intended to bring extraordinary experiences to life, while also enhancing the international companyâ€™s brand essence and the Montreal spirit. ',

    'subtitle2' => 'Process',
    'text2' => 'In order to understand the brand and build a hosting experience that really transcends it (while also being entertaining and engaging), we conducted extensive research on the audience that would be present, as well as on the Mercedes-Benz brand and any previous car show installations. ',

    'subtitle3' => 'Creative Solution',
    'text3' => 'From the arrival by boat to the internationally recognized barber, we created an immersive yet open environment that made each visitor feel they were living a unique and exclusive experience. We created scenography inspired by the science of aerodynamics, playing on points of view and the tension between intimacy/openness and shadow/light, while paying homage to the Mercedes-Benz brand universe. We tinted the whole experience with a  Montreal vibe by including an ultra-realistic VR Formula 1 simulator and a high-end culinary experience. ',

    'subtitle4' => 'Results',
    'text4' => 'Three days, 3000 participants. The Canadian Mercedes Grand Prix hosting team scored high compared to the average satisfaction of other Grand Prix experiences in the world. The average in-space dwell time was of 2.37 hours per participant. As for engagement, while the excitement was hard to miss, and the experiential area was fully occupied 98% of the time. ',
